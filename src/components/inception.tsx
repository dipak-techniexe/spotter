          <h4>OUR STORY</h4>
          <p>A bunch of long-lost friends decided to gather for a re-union. Walking down the memory lane, one friend started talking about their former adventures and misadventures, most being travel related. These were a bunch of travel-enthusiasts who would travel together pretty often until each got busy with the manic pace of life.</p>
          <p>Founder Shashin Patel then suggested that they plan a trip together once more, and the rest followed suit. He then dialed up another friend to get his itinerary from a recent trip. But alas! The call went unanswered. He tried again, and again but all in vain. While others were busy ringing up their friends and tour managers, a thought sprung up in Shashin’s mind that how very inconvenient is it for people to make travel plans.</p>
          <p>What if one doesn’t have the time to browse through the internet? What if a friend genuinely doesn’t remember the places he had visited? What if he is busy with work while you’re trying to reach him? What if you could document your travels in a way that they would serve as trip logs for future references, and were easily accessible to all who matter? What if all this laborious effort could be minimized to a simple view of a travel trail on one’s phone-screen? The idea for a travel-based app started to surface and the work began. Slowly yet progressively, the idea took shape but it would be a long time and endless hours of hard work before the app, now known as Spotter would be born, into its evolved form.</p>
          <p>Shashin believes in bringing families and friends closer, irrespective of the geographical distances between them. He believes, that to stay in touch and to communicate, all that we need is intent. Also, with Spotter, he aims to bring out the trailblazers in fellow travel-enthusiasts and basically anyone with a love for life! He believes that being together should be fun, each day should be fun, as we only live once!</p>
